# Git-concede

Concede to the power of git stash

## Usage

When you need to transfer your changes to another branch, this is what some people do:

1. Reset recent commit from the index to working tree
2. Stash changes (into working tree)
3. Checkout another branch and stash apply

TODO 
 - [] Allow user to either stash the working directory or just create a patch
 - [] Allow user to view first with git log
 - [] Maybe use python and/or node-git?
